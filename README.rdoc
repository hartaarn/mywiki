== Getting Started

Two things you'll need to do in order to start using the application is to set up user roles and assign an admin role to a user (if you need to).

Creating roles:

* open rails console:

  rails c

* create roles:

  r = Role.new
  r.name = "Admin"
  r.save
  r = Role.new
  r.name = "Member"
  r.save

* set admin role:

  u = User.first
  u.role_ids = [1]
  u.save
